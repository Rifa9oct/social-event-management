## FAQ

#### Question 1 :

Ans: A

Explain: Here we declare a variable named greeting, assign it an empty object { }, and then log this empty object to the console.

#### Question 2 :

Ans: C

Explain: The sum function takes two parameters a and b and returns their sum. However, when we call sum(1, "2"), it tries to add a number (1) and a string ("2") together, resulting in a string concatenation, not numeric addition.

#### Question 3 :

Ans: A

Explain: The code initializes an array food and an object info with the favoriteFood property set to the first element of the food array. Then, it changes the value of info.favoriteFood to "🍝". However, this change doesn't affect the original food array, so when we log food, it remains unchanged and still contains ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"].

#### Question 4 :
Ans: B

Explain: The sayHi function takes a name parameter and returns a greeting string. However, when we call sayHi() without providing an argument, it results in "Hi there, undefined" because name is not defined.

#### Question 5 :
Ans: C

Explain: The code initializes a variable count to 0 and an array nums with values [0, 1, 2, 3]. It then uses the forEach method to iterate through nums and increments count whenever a truthy value is encountered. In this case, all numbers except 0 are truthy, so count becomes 3, indicating the number of truthy values in the array.
